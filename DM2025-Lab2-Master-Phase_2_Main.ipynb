       "**Environmental Benefits:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Reduced Greenhouse Gas Emissions:** This is arguably the most significant benefit. Renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydro produce little to no greenhouse gases (like carbon dioxide and methane) during operation. This directly combats climate change and its associated impacts, such as rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and ecosystem disruption.\n",
       "*   **Improved Air Quality:** Unlike fossil fuels, renewables don't release harmful air pollutants like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. This leads to cleaner air, reducing respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular problems, and other health issues.\n",
       "*   **Reduced Water Usage:** Many renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind, require significantly less water for operation compared to traditional power plants that rely on water for cooling. This is crucial in water-scarce regions.\n",
       "*   **Minimized Land Disruption (in some cases):** While some renewable projects require land, technologies like offshore wind farms or rooftop solar panels have a smaller land footprint than large-scale mining operations or fossil fuel extraction sites.\n",

       "### Summary of Main Benefits of Renewable Energy\n",
       "\n",
       "Using renewable energy sources like solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass provides a wide array of powerful benefits for the environment, the economy, and society as a whole.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "#### 1. Environmental and Climate Benefits\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Reduces Greenhouse Gas Emissions:** This is the most critical benefit. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable energy sources generate electricity with little to no greenhouse gas emissions (like carbon dioxide), directly combating climate change and global warming.\n",
       "*   **Improves Air and Water Quality:** Burning fossil fuels releases harmful pollutants (like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides) that cause smog, acid rain, and respiratory illnesses. Renewables produce clean energy, leading to cleaner air and water and reducing pollution-related health problems.\n",
       "*   **Preserves Natural Resources:** Renewable energy harnesses natural processes that are inexhaustible (like sun and wind) or replenishable. This reduces our reliance on finite resources like coal, oil, and natural gas, which require destructive mining and drilling.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "#### 2. Economic Advantages\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Job Creation:** The renewable energy sector is a major source of job growth in manufacturing, installation, maintenance, and research, creating economic opportunities in both urban and rural areas.\n",
       "*   **Stable Energy Prices:** The fuel for renewable energy (sunshine, wind) is free. While there are initial infrastructure costs, renewables are not subject to the price volatility and geopolitical instability that affect global oil and gas markets. This leads to more predictable and stable energy costs for consumers and businesses in the long run.\n",
       "*   **Economic Development and Investment:** Investing in renewable energy projects stimulates local economies, attracts new technologies, and can provide new revenue streams for landowners and communities, particularly in rural regions with wind or solar farms.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "#### 3. Energy Security and Independence\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Reduced Dependence on Foreign Imports:** By developing domestic renewable resources, countries can reduce their reliance on imported fossil fuels from politically unstable regions. This enhances national security and insulates their economies from global energy conflicts and supply disruptions.\n",
       "*   **Resilient and Decentralized Energy Systems:** Many renewable technologies, like rooftop solar, can be distributed across the grid. This decentralized model makes the energy system more resilient and less vulnerable to large-scale failures or attacks compared to a system reliant on a few large, centralized power plants.\n",
       "*   **Energy Access for Remote Areas:** Renewables are an excellent solution for bringing power to remote or off-grid communities that are not connected to a main electricity grid, improving quality of life, education, and economic opportunities.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "#### 4. Public Health and Social Benefits\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Improved Public Health:** By reducing air and water pollution, the widespread adoption of renewable energy leads to fewer respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, resulting in lower healthcare costs and a healthier population.\n",
       "*   **Sustainable for Future Generations:** Unlike fossil fuels that will eventually run out, renewable energy sources are sustainable over the long term, ensuring that future generations will have the energy they need without inheriting a polluted planet."

      "\t\t Common types include supervised learning (learning from labeled data), unsupervised learning (finding patterns in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (learning through trial and error with rewards and penalties). \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Applications \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t ML is used in a wide range of applications, such as image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, fraud detection, and medical diagnosis. \n",

      "Data Centers \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Definition \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t A data center is a dedicated physical facility that an organization uses to house its critical IT infrastructure, including servers, storage systems, networking equipment, and related components. These facilities are designed to provide a secure, reliable, and controlled environment for computing operations. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Key Components \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t Essential components include servers, storage devices, network switches and routers, power supplies (including UPS and generators), cooling systems (HVAC), and physical security measures. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Purpose \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t Data centers serve as the central hub for data storage, processing, and management, enabling businesses to run applications, host websites, and manage their digital operations. \n",

      "Large Language Models (LLMs) \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Definition \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence model that are trained on massive amounts of text data. They are designed to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. LLMs are characterized by their enormous size (billions or trillions of parameters) and their ability to perform a wide variety of natural language processing tasks. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Capabilities \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t LLMs can perform tasks such as text generation, translation, summarization, question answering, code generation, and creative writing. They learn complex linguistic patterns, grammar, facts, and reasoning abilities from their training data. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Underlying Technology \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t LLMs are typically built using deep learning architectures, most notably the Transformer architecture, which allows them to process sequential data like text very effectively. \n",
      "\n",
      "Relationship Between Machine Learning, Data Centers, and LLMs \n",
      "\n",
      "\t LLMs as a Product of Machine Learning \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t LLMs are a sophisticated application and outcome of machine learning research and development. The techniques used to train LLMs, such as deep learning and neural networks, are core machine learning concepts. Therefore, LLMs are a specific, advanced type of machine learning model. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Data Centers as the Foundation for LLMs and ML \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t Training and running LLMs, as well as many other complex machine learning models, requires immense computational power and vast amounts of data storage. Data centers provide the necessary infrastructure – high-performance servers, specialized hardware (like GPUs and TPUs), robust networking, and reliable power – to handle these computationally intensive tasks. Without data centers, it would be practically impossible to develop, train, and deploy LLMs at scale. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Interdependence \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t In essence, machine learning is the field of study and the set of techniques. LLMs are a powerful manifestation of these techniques. Data centers are the physical environments and infrastructure that enable the training, deployment, and operation of both general machine learning models and highly demanding LLMs. LLMs rely on ML principles, and both ML and LLMs rely heavily on the resources provided by data centers. \n",

    "\n",
    "LLM embeddings are dense numerical vectors that represent the semantic meaning of text. Generated by Large Language Models, they map words, phrases, or documents into a high-dimensional space where similar concepts are positioned closely together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their key advantages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Contextual Understanding:** Unlike older methods, LLM embeddings are contextual. The vector for a word like **\"bank\"** will be different depending on whether it's used in the context of a \"river bank\" or a \"money bank,\" providing a more nuanced representation of language.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Versatility from Pre-training:** They are pre-trained on vast amounts of text data. This allows them to generalize effectively across various tasks, such as classification, clustering, and similarity detection. They do not require extensive retraining.\n",

Texts can contain mixed feelings (e.g., \"bittersweet\") or use similar language to express different emotions, causing their embeddings to be naturally close in semantic space. And also the process of projecting high-dimensional embeddings down to a 2D visualization inevitably loses some information, which can make distinct clusters appear to overlap."

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "\n",
    "   JOY (Best Performance):\n",
    "   - Works well in all methods (85% accuracy)\n",
    "   - Easy to identify with clear positive language\n",
    "   \n",
    "   FEAR (Worst Performance):\n",
    "   - Struggles in all methods (20-35% accuracy)\n",

    "3. MAIN FINDINGS:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Adding just 1 example helps a lot (from 47.5% to 53.8%)\n",
    "   - Going from 1-shot to 5-shot doesn't improve much\n",

    "- **What happens:** Model gets the emotion WRONG in 0-shot, but RIGHT when given examples\n",
    "- **Why it matters:** Shows that examples help the model understand ambiguous emotional language\n",
    "- **Key insight:** Most improvement happens from 0-shot to 1-shot; additional examples (5-shot) provide minimal extra benefit\n",
    "\n",
    "### CASE 2: CLASSIFICATION DOES NOT IMPROVE (Always Wrong)\n",
    "- **What happens:** Model consistently misclassifies the same texts regardless of how many examples it receives\n",
    "- **Why it matters:** Reveals inherent limitations in emotion classification\n",
    "- **Key insight:** Some texts contain:\n",
    "  - Mixed emotions (e.g., bittersweet feelings)\n",
    "  - Sarcasm or irony\n",
    "  - Overlap between similar emotions (especially fear vs. anger)\n",
    "  - Ambiguous language that's hard even for humans to classify\n",
    "\n",
    "### CASE 3: CLASSIFICATION GETS WORSE WITH MORE EXAMPLES\n",
    "- **What happens:** Model is CORRECT in 0-shot but becomes WRONG after seeing examples\n",
    "- **Why it matters:** Shows that more examples don't always help—they can sometimes mislead\n",
    "- **Key insight:** Examples might:\n",
    "  - Introduce bias toward specific patterns in the training examples\n",
    "  - Cause the model to overfit to example styles rather than true emotion\n",
    "  - Add noise when examples aren't representative of the test case\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Diminishing Returns:** The jump from 0-shot to 1-shot is significant, but 5-shot barely improves over 1-shot\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Quality Over Quantity:** The quality and relevance of examples matters more than having many examples\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inherent Difficulty:** Some emotions (fear, anger, sadness) have overlapping language patterns that make perfect separation impossible\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optimal Strategy:** 1-shot prompting appears to be the sweet spot—providing enough context without overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion:\n",
    "Few-shot prompting helps but has clear limits. The similarity in emotional language and the subjective nature of emotion make some classifications fundamentally challenging, regardless of the number of examples provided."

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
